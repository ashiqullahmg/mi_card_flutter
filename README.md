# mi_card_flutter

A new Flutter application.
## This is a simple Flutter UI Card
  This is my first application in Flutter. In runApp() I have called MyApp which is a stateless widget, where I have return MaterialApp. In MaterialApp property "home:" I have used Scafold. I din't want to have an appBar and due to that reason, I did enclosed everyhing in a SafeArea. Custom fonts from fonts.google.com are being used in this project.
